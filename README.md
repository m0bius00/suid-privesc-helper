# suid-privesc-helper
This is a very specific C language Program that is designed to be portable and GLIB_C Independent. I wrote this during my CTFs when I spent substantial amount of time finding exploits for privesc that satisfied the target system's glibc and library version match dependencies. This works only in SUID scenarios where file perm is 4755.
This works in Post-exploitation scenarios in Pentesting and CTFs where you have the initial foothold and are able to manipulate file permissions in a specific directory, for example in /home. Setting the exploit file permission to SUID permissions (4755) somehow, compiling it statically; whether in attacker system and transferring it using an external server, or in the target system itself, via -static flag in gcc or resonant ones in other compilers. Setting the statically compiled binary permissions to 4755 (THIS IS IMPORTANT) and running it.
