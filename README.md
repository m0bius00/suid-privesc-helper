# suid-privesc-helper
This is a very specific C language Program that is designed to be portable and GLIB_C Independent. I wrote this during my CTFs when I spent substantial amount of time finding exploits for privesc that satisfied the target system's glibc and library version match dependencies. This works only in SUID scenarios where file perm is 4755.
